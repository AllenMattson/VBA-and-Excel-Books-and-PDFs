EXCEL 2010 POWER PROGRAMMING WITH VBA
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This readme provides information on the following topics:

* System Requirements

* Using the CD

* Files and software on the CD

* Troubleshooting

========================================================================
System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements
listed in this section. If your computer doesn't match up to most of
these requirements, you may have a problem using the contents of the CD.

* A Windows PC with Microsoft Excel 2010.

* A CD-ROM drive.

========================================================================
Using the CD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the items from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps:

1. Insert the CD into your computer's CD-ROM drive.

<<Note>> The interface won't launch if you have autorun
disabled. In that case, click Start-->Run. In the dialog box
that appears, type D:\start.exe. (Replace D with the proper
letter if your CD drive uses a different letter. If you don't
know the letter, see how your CD drive is listed under My
Computer.) Click OK.

2. The CD-ROM interface will appear.  The interface provides a
simple point-and-click way to explore the contents of the CD.

========================================================================
Files and Software on the CD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections provide more details about the software and other 
materials available on the CD.

Applications

Adobe Reader is a freeware application for viewing files in the Adobe 
Portable Document format.

Shareware programs are fully functional, trial versions of copyrighted 
programs. If you like particular programs, register with their authors 
for a nominal fee and receive licenses, enhanced versions, and 
technical support.

Freeware programs are copyrighted games, applications, and utilities 
that are free for personal use. Unlike shareware, these programs do not 
require a fee or provide technical support. 

GNU software is governed by its own license, which is included inside 
the folder of the GNU product. See the GNU license for more details. 

Trial, demo, or evaluation versions are usually limited either by time 
or functionality (such as being unable to save projects). Some trial 
versions are very sensitive to system date changes. If you alter your 
computer's date, the programs will "time out" and no longer be 
functional.

eBook version of Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA
The complete text of the book you hold in your hands is provided on the 
CD in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). You can read and quickly 
search the content of this PDF file by using Adobe's Acrobat Reader, 
also included on the CD. Or, you can load the file onto an ebook reader,
such as Kindle.

Sample files for Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA
The CD contains more than 300 files used as examples in the book. The 
files are organized by chapter. With a few exceptions, the files are 
all Excel 2010 files that have one of the following extensions:

	* .xlsx: An Excel workbook file.
	* .xlsm: An Excel workbook file that contains VBA macros.
	* .xlam: An Excel add-in file that contains VBA macros.

When you open an XLSM file, Excel may display a security warning that 
tells you that macros have been disabled. To enable macros, click the 
Options button in the security warning panel and then select Enable 
This Content.

Because the files on this CD are from a trusted source, you may want 
to copy the files to your hard drive and then designate the folder as 
a trusted location. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open an Explorer window and double-click the CD-ROM drive that 
   contains the companion CD-ROM.
2. Right-click the folder that corresponds to the root folder for the 
   sample files and choose Copy from the shortcut menu.
3. Activate the folder on your hard drive where you'd like to copy the 
   files, right-click the directory, and choose Paste from the shortcut 
   menu.
   
   The CD-ROM files will be copied to a subfolder in the folder you 
   specified in Step 3.

To designate this new folder as a trusted location:
1. Start Excel and choose File-->Options to display the Excel Options 
   dialog box.
2. In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Trust Center tab.
3. Click the Trust Center Settings button.
4. In the Trust Center dialog box, click the Trusted Locations tab.
5. Click the Add New Location button to display the Microsoft Office 
   Trusted Location dialog box.
6. In the Microsoft Office Trusted Location dialog box, click the 
   Browse button and locate the folder that contains the files copied 
   from the CD-ROM.
7. Make sure you select the option labeled Subfolders of This Location 
   Are Also Trusted.

After performing these steps, when you open XLSM files from this 
location, the macros are enabled and you don't see the security warning.

Following is a list of the sample files, along with a brief description. 
Examples that use multiple files are contained in a separate 
subdirectory.

Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have difficulty installing or using any of the materials on the
companion CD, try the following solutions:

* Turn off any antivirus software that you may have running.
Installers sometimes mimic virus activity and can make your
computer incorrectly believe that it is being infected by a
virus. (Be sure to turn the antivirus software back on later.)

* Close all running programs. The more programs you're running,
the less memory is available to other programs. Installers also
typically update files and programs; if you keep other programs
running, installation may not work properly.
