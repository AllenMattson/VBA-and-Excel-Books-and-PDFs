Hi there,


Remember you will have change the connection string to match your database setup!

* And you will need to restore the pubs database, as detailed at the start of Chapter 9.

** Alternatively, you can execute the FillPubsDatabase.sql script (its in the FillPubsDatabase folder)
   from Query Analyzer to create and populate the missing tables.

** Otherwise, checkout ReadMe.Pdf in the FillsPubsDatabase folder for instructions on using a
   Visual Studio .NET Database project to create the required tables.

Any more problems, contact support@wrox.com

Enjoy!
